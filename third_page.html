                        A nobleman was very jealous of his wife. He had no reason to doubt of her love and fidelity, but he was easy prey to 
                        slander, and so, when his wife had their first child, he refused to recognize the baby as his own. He was more than
                         sure that the child was the fruit of his wife’s infidelity.

                        No matter how much the woman tried to assure him that she had not been with another man, he continued to reject his infant son.
                        
                        In her desperation the wife and mother came to St. Anthony for help. The Saint talked to the nobleman for hours, 
                        and finally succeeded in making him see the absurdity behind his jealousy. Just then a nurse brought in the infant.
                         Instantly, his old state of mind returned. At this point Anthony turned to the child and said, "In 
                         the name of Jesus Christ, speak and tell who your father is!" The infant pointed to the nobleman and, 
                         in a voice of a child years older, he said, "There is my father!" With that the father broke down in tears 
                         and took the child in his arms.
                          This is how Anthony saved a family and a marriage from the pitfalls of gossip and slander.

                        A few years after St. Anthony’s death, Ezzelino extended his dominion by brute force to all of the main cities in the Veneto Region: 
                        Verona, Vicenza, Treviso, Feltre, Belluno and Padua.

                        In 1254, four years after the death of Emperor Frederick II, Ezzelino was excommunicated by Pope Innocent IV, who also
                         launched a crusade against him. Padua was therefore besieged by the Pope's forces, which wanted to free the city 
                         of Ezzelino's tyranny. The Blessed Luke asked for
                         St. Anthony's help so that the pope's army may be successful. Naturally, it's not only Blessed Luke who
                          was praying, but with him were praying the citizens of Padua who were still in bondage within the city's walls.
                        
                        St. Anthony appeared to two Franciscan friars (one of them is probably the Blessed Luke Belludi), 
                        and foretold them about the imminent liberation of Padua from Ezzelino's tyranny. And this is what 
                        actually occurred in 1256 when Ezzelino’s troops were driven out from Padua. The citizens of the city were finally free; 
                        their prayers had been answered through the intercession of St. Anthony.

                    As we know Anthony died in 1231 and was buried for the time being in a 
                    little church dedicated to the Virgin Mary Mater Domini, Mother of God, while waiting for the
                     Basilica to be at least partially completed so that the body could be kept in a much worthier tomb.
                      His funeral took place on the following Tuesday.  Thousands and thousands of people followed his coffin, 
                      and they were all crying like babies because they saw him as a father, and not because he was a priest, Father 
                      Anthony, but because he was a real father to them. He had generated faith in them, and was constantly defending them. 
                      On the day of the funeral, a woman came whose name deserves to be remembered. She was called Cunizza, 
                      and had been ill for a year. A great tumor had formed on her shoulder, and she was only able to walk by
                       hobbling along with the aid of crutches. Coming to the tomb, where Anthony had just been buried in, she 
                       prostrated herself in prayer. A short while later she realised that the swelling had disappeared, leaving 
                       her skin smooth and clear. She threw aside her crutches and stood upright, with tears of joy, and she went
                        home giving thanks to God and her dear friend St. Anthony.

                    And this was the first miracle that happened here, around St. Anthony’s Tomb. The news spread rapidly, 
                    and people who were sick in the soul and body started coming to the Tomb in ever greater numbers.
