                        In the 13th century, usury was a growing business. A business condemned by Saint Anthony. 
                        During the funeral of a usurer, he said that the man had no longer a heart.
                         When they opened the rib cage of the dead usurer, the heart was missing. 
                         And was found in his money trunk.

                        Ezzelino da Romano was a Ghibelline of the eponymous medieval political faction 
                        supporting the Holy Roman emperor against the Pope. 
                        He captured certain Guelphs (the supporters of the Pope) and threatened
                         to execute them. But Saint Anthony, standing before him, told him to convert. And so he did.

                    Once Anthony had travelled to the city of Rimini because it was a hotbed of heresy. The city leaders had ordered everyone to 
                    ignore him, so no one turned up for his homilies. Wherever Anthony went, he was greeted by silence.

                    Anthony walked along praying and reflecting upon what had happened. As he walked outside of the town, 
                    he came to the mouth of the Marecchia River where it flows into the Adriatic. There he began to address the crowds, not of people but of fish.
                    
                    He called out, “You, fish of the river and sea, listen to the Word of God because the heretics do not wish to hear it.” Suddenly there were thousands of fish neatly arranged in rows, all pushing their heads through the surface of the water as if they were straining to listen to every one of Anthony’s words.
                    
                    The people of Rimini, seeing this miracle, gathered to listen to Anthony. What began with simple interest in an extraordinary event turned into a passionate conviction that Anthony was speaking to their very hearts. They were so moved by Anthony’s words, by his call to conversion, that they abandoned their hardened positions and returned to the Church. As we stated above, we are not sure that this story is historic, but it certainly does represent a version of what often happened when Anthony preached: that many
                     hardened sinners were converted through the unselfish love of Anthony.

                    “Only if my mule kneels down to the Eucharist”: this was the condition imposed by a heretic to believe that
                     a host could really become the body and blood of Christ. And told it to Saint Anthony. 
                     The man starved his mule for the next three days. On the day of the test, Saint Anthony consecrated the host.
                      The hungry mule had two choices: the Eucharist by Saint Anthony or some fodder by the heretic. 
                      The mule chose the Eucharist and knelt down to it.

                    To rest and recover his strength, Saint Anthony went to a hermitage in Camposampiero. 
                    At that time of the year, the hermitage was quite damp.
                     And Saint Anthony was seen admiring an immense walnut tree.
                      Count Tiso, who invited Anthony to the hermitage, built a small house on that tree.
                      One night, Tiso saw a powerful light coming from Anthony's house on the tree.
                     The count entered the room. There was Saint Anthony embracing the Baby Jesus.
