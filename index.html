                    The Miracle of the Usurer</h2>
                <img src="usurer.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <div>
                In the 13th century, usury was a growing business. A business condemned by Saint Anthony.
                During the funeral of a usurer, he said that the man had no longer a heart.
                When they opened the rib cage of the dead usurer, the heart was missing.
                And was found in his money trunk.

                    The Miracle of Ezzelino da Romano</h2>
                <img src="romona.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <div>
                Ezzelino da Romano was a Ghibelline of the eponymous medieval political faction
                supporting the Holy Roman emperor against the Pope.
                He captured certain Guelphs (the supporters of the Pope) and threatened
                to execute them. But Saint Anthony, standing before him, told him to convert. And so he did.

                <img src="fish_miracle.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <div>

                Anthony visited Rimini, a heretical city. Ignored by the leaders, he spoke to fish at the river's mouth,
                prompting the townsfolk's curiosity. They were moved by his words, abandoned heresy, and returned to the
                Church. This tale, while possibly not historical, highlights Anthony's ability to convert hardened
                sinners through love.

                <img src="mule.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <div>
                “Only if my mule kneels down to the Eucharist”: this was the condition imposed by a heretic to believe
                that
                a host could really become the body and blood of Christ. And told it to Saint Anthony.
                The man starved his mule for the next three days. On the day of the test, Saint Anthony consecrated the
                host.
                The hungry mule had two choices: the Eucharist by Saint Anthony or some fodder by the heretic.
                The mule chose the Eucharist and knelt down to it.

                <img src="baby_jesus.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <div>
                To rest and recover his strength, Saint Anthony went to a hermitage in Camposampiero.
                At that time of the year, the hermitage was quite damp.
                And Saint Anthony was seen admiring an immense walnut tree.
                Count Tiso, who invited Anthony to the hermitage, built a small house on that tree.
                One night, Tiso saw a powerful light coming from Anthony's house on the tree.
                The count entered the room. There was Saint Anthony embracing the Baby Jesus.
