                St. Anthony's 5th miracle: 20-month-old Tommy fell into boiling water near the Basilica. His mother, in
                desperation, promised to donate her child's weight in bread to the poor if he was revived. Miraculously,
                while she prayed, Tommy awoke as if from a deep sleep, demonstrating the saint's powerful intervention.

                St. Anthony's 6th miracle involved a young girl who had fallen into a well. Her distraught mother prayed
                for her rescue, pledging to visit the Basilica in gratitude. Suddenly, a mysterious light illuminated
                the well, and the girl floated safely to the surface, unharmed. This miraculous event further solidified
                St. Anthony's reputation for divine intervention.

                In Lisbon, two bitter rivals' sons met, and in a fit of hatred, one killed the other and buried the body
                in Anthony's father's garden. Anthony, away in Padua, learned of his father's plight through divine
                revelation. He obtained permission to travel, covering 1,200 miles in hours. In court, he summoned the
                murdered man's spirit, which identified the true killer and exonerated Anthony's father. The revived man
                sought absolution, then passed away again. The next day, Anthony returned to Padua, having been away
                only for a single night, showcasing a miraculous intervention.

                St. Anthony's 9th miracle involved a woman who had lost a precious necklace. She prayed to the saint,
                promising a donation to the Basilica if it was found. Moments later, her necklace mysteriously appeared
                at her feet, reaffirming the saint's reputation for answering fervent prayers and performing miraculous
                acts.
