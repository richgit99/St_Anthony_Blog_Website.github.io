                        Tommy was a 20-month- old boy who lived with his parents near the Basilica. His mother had left him playing in the kitchen,
                         where there was a large pot on the fire with boiling water in it. The little boy took a stool and started to peep into pot.
                          He saw his own reflection and wanted to touch it, but in doing so he fell into the boiling water. 
                        Immediately afterward, the mother was back, and when she saw Tommy’s feet sticking up out of the pot, 
                        she run to pull him out, but the boy was already dead.
<br><br>
                        The poor mother’s screams roused the whole neighbourhood, and soon a crowd had gathered at
                         the house, including some friars from the Basilica. Seeing the friars, the woman was reminded of 
                         the wonderful miracles done by St. Anthony, and began to pray loudly for his help, promising to
                          donate her child’s weight in bread to the poor if he were restored to life. While the mother was still praying,
                           Tommy arose as if from a deep sleep.

                        A young girl in Padua called Eurilia had followed her mother in one of her visits to an old lady.
                         Eurilia however, stayed outside to gather sticks and twigs for the fire. After a while, at the end of her visit,
                          the mother came out and found her daughter floating on a muddy pond, face up. 
                          Somehow Eurilia had slipped into the water and drowned.
                           The poor woman waded in and dragged the body up on to the road, but the young girl seemed lifeless.
                            The poor mother started to cry and a small crowd gathered around her.
                             One of the men present saw that the girl was cold and rigid, and said that she was dead.
                              At this point in her anguish the mother begged the Saint to pray to Christ to save her daughter, “Oh please, 
                              St. Anthony, give me back my daughter.”
                               Shortly after this simple prayer everyone could see that Eurilia's lips began to twitch,
                                and then she started to throw out the water she had swallowed. And so, after a short while, 
                                through the merits of St. Anthony, Eurilia grew warm again and came back to life.

                    In Lisbon, the city where St. Anthony was born, there were two people who hated each other to death. 
                    One evening the son of one of them met the son from the rival family, which was living close to St. Anthony’s parents.
                     Filled with hatred, and seeing that no one else was around, he stabbed the other young man to death.

He then buried the corpse in the garden of Anthony’s father. Martin, Anthony’s father, tried to prove his innocence, 
but the grisly evidence found in the family garden was enough to convict the poor man of the murder.

Just when things were at their worst, God revealed to Anthony, who was in Padua, the plight of his father. 
Immediately, the Saint obtained permission to go away for a night. The distance from Padua to Lisbon is approximately 1,200 miles, 
but Anthony was there in a couple of hours through divine intervention. In the court room the Saint asked that the 
body of the murdered man be produced immediately. Anthony approached the corpse and, in a firm voice, asked the man
 to tell who had killed him. To the amazement of all, the corpse sat up and clearly said the name of the murderer and attested
  the innocence of Anthony's father, who was freed at once. The revived man then turned to Anthony and asked absolution from his sins, 
  then he died again. Miraculously, the next day the Saint was back in Padua. 
After all, he had asked permission to be away only over night.

                    According to the story, the funeral of a rich man was being celebrated with great pomp in a city in Tuscany.
                     Anthony was present, and is said to have commented that the dead man did not deserve such honour 
                     since he had exploited and oppressed the poor. “His heart is in his money-box”, said the Saint, echoing our Lord’s 
                     words that “where your treasure is, there your heart will be too”.

                    So far, so good; but the story goes on to say that, following Anthony’s words, a surgeon was called in, 
                    who cut open the dead body and found no heart! A little later, when the family opened the dead man’s
                     treasure chest, there was the heart! As a result, the dead man was not buried in the splendid
                      mausoleum that he had prepared for himself, but in a cave by the river. In the center of the
                       fresco you can see the surgeon opening the body of the miser,
                     and on the left a relative of the rich man who has just found his heart in the money-box.

                    This miracle took place in a city in Tuscany. There was a knight in the area who was outstanding
                     for his nobility and his wealth, but he easily gave way to outbursts of anger. One day, his wife, a
                      virtuous lady, probably replied to him harshly, and he was overcome with rage. He beat her, 
                    raining punches and kicks upon her; he dragged her by her hair all throughout the house; eventually 
                     stabbed her, leaving her at the point of death.

                    Servants and family members picked the woman up and gently laid her down on her bed.
                    
                    In the meantime, the knight began to regret his beastly behaviour, and ran to St. Anthony,
                     who was living in the city in that period. The man fervently begged St. Anthony to come and
                      help his poor wife. The saint hurried to the house together with the husband; he knelt down, 
                      asking God to give the dying woman life and health. When Anthony prayed over her, she rose up completely well again.
